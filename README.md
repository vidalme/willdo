-> Categories: you can create and organize categories for your tasks, organization is key.<br/>
-> Favorites : Tasks can be favorited and brought up to the top of the list and labeling them very important.<br/>
-> Redo: Tasks can be brought back to the todo list after they've been finished, also you can delete them permanently<br/>
-> Local storage: All data persists in the browser, throughout undefined span of time.<br/>
-> 100% responsive.<br/>
